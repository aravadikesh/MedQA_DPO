The patient denies swelling of her feet and difficulty breathing at night or while lying down. Physical examination is significant for conjunctival pallor. A peripheral blood smear reveals macrocytosis and hypersegmented granulocytes. Which of the following substances, if elevated in this patient’s blood, would support the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency?\\n\\nOptions:\\nA. Methionine\\nB. Cysteine\\nC. Homocysteine\\nD. Methylmalonyl-CoA\\n\\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.D. Methylmalonyl-CoA\\nExplanation: Elevated methylmalonyl-CoA supports vitamin B12 deficiency, as B12 is required for its conversion to succinyl-CoA. The patient's macrocytic anemia and hypersegmented neutrophils indicate impaired DNA synthesis due to B12 deficiency.\"]\n",
