The investigators ultimately found that the rate of syphilis was 30% higher in patients with active cocaine use compared to patients without cocaine use. This study is best described as which of the following?\n\nOptions:\nA. Case-control study\nB. Meta-analysis\nC. Cross-sectional study\nD. Retrospective cohort study\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nD.

{"prompt":"Question: A 69-year-old woman presents to her physician\u2019s office with cough, increasing fatigue, and reports an alarming loss of 15 kg (33 lb) weight over the last 4 months. She says that she has observed this fatigue and cough to be present over the past year, but pushed it aside citing her age as a reason. The cough has been progressing and the weight loss is really worrying her. She also observed blood-tinged sputum twice over the last week. Past medical history is noncontributory. She does not smoke and does not use recreational drugs. She is relatively active and follows a healthy diet. Today, her vitals are normal. On examination, she appears frail and pale. At auscultation, her lung has a slight expiratory wheeze. A chest X-ray shows a coin-shaped lesion in the periphery of the middle lobe of the right lung. The nodule is biopsied by interventional radiology (see image). Which of the following types of cancer is most likely associated with this patient\u2019s symptoms?\n\nOptions:\nA. Mesothelioma\nB.
