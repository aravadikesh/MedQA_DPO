The tricuspid valve is the most common valve affected by bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot.  \nExplanation: In uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot, the most common valve affected by bacterial endocarditis is actually the pulmonary valve, not the tricuspid valve. The pulmonary valve is subjected to abnormal flow dynamics due to the outflow obstruction, making it more susceptible to infection. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.  \nExplanation: This statement is true. Patients with tetralogy of Fallot can have normal hemoglobin levels while still being iron deficient, especially if they have chronic hypoxia or other factors affecting iron metabolism.

{"prompt": "Question: A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina.

When the diameter of a vessel is reduced, the radius is also reduced. A 50% reduction in diameter means the new diameter is 50% of the original, which results in a radius that is also 50% of the original. \n\nIf the original diameter is D, the new diameter is 0.5D, and the radius (r) changes from r to 0.5r. The resistance (R) can be calculated as follows:\n\nR = 8ηL / πr^4\n\nIf the radius is halved (0.5r), the new resistance becomes:\n\nR_new = 8ηL / π(0.5r)^4 = 8ηL / π(0.0625r^4) = 16 * (8ηL / πr^4) = 16R_original\n\nThus, the resistance increases by a factor of 16. However, since the question asks for the increase in resistance relative to a vessel with no occlusion, we must consider the total resistance increase from the original state. \n\nThe total resistance is now 16 times the original resistance, which means the increase factor is 16. However, since the question asks for the factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion, we must consider the original resistance as 1, leading to a total resistance of 16. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 64, as the increase in resistance is calculated based on the fourth power of the radius reduction.", "model_answer": "A", "ground_truth": "B. 16\nExplanation: Resistance to blood flow increases with the fourth power of the radius.

Neural tube defect  \nExplanation: The elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, which is three times the median, is most commonly associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) during pregnancy. In cases of NTDs, the fetal neural tissue is exposed to the amniotic fluid, leading to increased AFP levels in the maternal serum. The normal levels of β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A further support the diagnosis of an NTD, as these markers are typically altered in conditions like Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) or Trisomy 18. Therefore, the combination of significantly elevated AFP with normal levels of the other markers points towards a neural tube defect as the most likely explanation for the findings.", "model_answer": "B", "ground_truth": "B.

It is reabsorbed to some extent in the proximal convoluted tubule, but not as much as other substances like glucose or amino acids.\n\n2. **Tubular Fluid-to-Plasma Concentration Ratio**: This ratio indicates how concentrated a substance is in the tubular fluid compared to the plasma. A ratio greater than 1 means the substance is more concentrated in the tubular fluid than in plasma, while a ratio less than 1 indicates the opposite.\n\n3. **Expected Behavior of Urea**: In the proximal convoluted tubule, urea is typically reabsorbed less efficiently than water and solutes like sodium. Therefore, the tubular fluid concentration of urea would generally be lower than that in plasma, especially in the early parts of the proximal tubule.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Graph**: If the graph shows a concentration ratio that starts below 1 and remains below 1 throughout the proximal convoluted tubule, that would suggest that urea is being reabsorbed less than water and other solutes.\n\n5. **Choosing the Best Answer**: Based on the above reasoning, if the options A, B, C, D, and E correspond to different ratios, you would select the option that indicates a tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea that is less than 1.\n\nSince I cannot see the graph or the options, I recommend you apply this reasoning to determine which option best reflects the expected behavior of urea in the proximal convoluted tubule.", "model_answer": "Unknown", "ground_truth": "A.

Carbonic anhydrase\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.", "model_response": "B. Pyruvate kinase  \nExplanation: Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the glycolytic pathway, specifically in the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is important for regulating oxygen release from hemoglobin. Elevated levels of bisphosphoglycerate mutase are typically found in red blood cells, which have a high demand for glycolysis and thus require efficient energy production. Pyruvate kinase is also a key enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzing the final step of converting phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. In cells with elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase, such as red blood cells, pyruvate kinase activity may be downregulated or absent due to the high levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which can inhibit pyruvate kinase activity. Therefore, the presence of elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase suggests that pyruvate kinase may be absent or significantly reduced in these cells.", "model_answer": "B", "ground_truth": "A. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase\nExplanation: Elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase suggests a focus on anaerobic metabolism, typically seen in red blood cells. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, involved in aerobic metabolism, is likely absent in these cells.", "ground_truth_answer": "A", "question": "An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types.

Add a thiazolidinedione\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.", "model_response": "C. Add a sulfonylurea  \nExplanation: The patient has an HbA1C of 8.5%, indicating that his diabetes is not well controlled despite being on metformin and lifestyle modifications for 3 months. According to the American Diabetes Association guidelines, when a patient's HbA1C is above the target (usually <7% for most adults), and they are already on metformin, the next step is to add another oral agent to help achieve better glycemic control. Sulfonylureas are effective in lowering blood glucose levels and can be added to metformin therapy. Starting basal-bolus insulin may be considered later if the patient continues to have poor control or if there are other indications, but it is not the first step in this scenario. Thiazolidinediones are also an option but are less commonly used due to potential side effects and are not the first-line add-on therapy.", "model_answer": "C", "ground_truth": "C.

{"prompt": "Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia.

The woman has the disease, indicating she is homozygous for the CFTR mutation (genotype ff). Her husband, from a population with a prevalence of 1/100, has a 1/100 chance of being a carrier (genotype Ff) and a 99/100 chance of being non-carrier (genotype FF). \n\nTo calculate the probability of their child having cystic fibrosis:\n1. If the husband is a carrier (1/100 chance), the child will inherit one CF allele from the mother (f) and one from the father (f), resulting in ff (affected).\n2. If the husband is not a carrier (99/100 chance), the child will inherit one CF allele from the mother (f) and one normal allele from the father (F), resulting in Ff (unaffected).\n\nThus, the probability that their child will inherit the disease is:\n- Probability that the father is a carrier (1/100) multiplied by the probability that the child will inherit the disease if the father is a carrier (1, since the mother is ff) = 1/100 * 1 = 1/100.\n- Probability that the father is not a carrier (99/100) multiplied by the probability that the child will inherit the disease if the father is not a carrier (0, since the child will be Ff) = 99/100 * 0 = 0.\n\nAdding these probabilities together gives:\n1/100 + 0 = 1/100.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the chance that their child will have the disease, we need to consider the population prevalence of the disease in the husband's population. The chance that their child will inherit the disease from the mother and the father being a carrier is 1/100. \n\nThus, the chance that their child will have the disease is 9/100, considering the prevalence of the disease in the population and the carrier status of the father.", "model_answer": "A", "ground_truth": "A. 9/100\nExplanation: The woman has an autosomal recessive condition, so her genotype is likely homozygous recessive (aa).
