She also reports that he has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The boy reports that he is upset because he can\u2019t always keep up with his friends in the playground. His past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis. The patient\u2019s temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.\n\nWhat changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?\n\nOptions:\nA. Maintain current therapy\nB. Add fluticasone daily\nC. Add salmeterol twice daily\nD. Add zileuton twice daily\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.", "true_response": "B. Add fluticasone daily\nExplanation: The boy\u2019s increased albuterol use and nighttime awakenings indicate poorly controlled asthma. Adding daily fluticasone (an inhaled corticosteroid) will help reduce inflammation and improve control.", "model_response": "B. Add fluticasone daily\nExplanation: The patient has persistent asthma symptoms, nighttime awakenings, and an increased use of albuterol, indicating inadequate control. Fluticasone, a corticosteroid, is added to control inflammation and reduce exacerbations."}
{"prompt": "Question: A 25-year-old woman comes to the office complaining of pelvic pain and feeling \u201coff\u201d for the past few weeks. She has not had any changes in diet or lifestyle but reports weight loss despite an increase in appetite. In addition, she has been experiencing chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical exam of her thyroid is unremarkable but her TSH was found to be 0.21 mIU/L. A complex structure in her right ovary was detected on ultrasound. Her symptoms can be explained by which of the following?\n\nOptions:\nA. Meigs syndrome\nB. Jod-Basedow phenomenon\nC. Dermoid cyst\nD. Struma ovarii\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.", "true_response": "D.

{"prompt": "Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1\u00df, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques.
