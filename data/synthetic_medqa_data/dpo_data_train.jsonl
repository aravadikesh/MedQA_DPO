{"prompt": "Question: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7째F (36.5째C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?\n\nOptions:\nA. Ampicillin\nB. Ceftriaxone\nC. Doxycycline\nD. Nitrofurantoin\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.", "chosen": "D. Nitrofurantoin\nExplanation: Nitrofurantoin is the best treatment for this patient, as she likely has a urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy. It is safe and effective for treating uncomplicated UTIs in pregnant women.", "rejected": "A. Ampicillin\nExplanation: Ampicillin is a safe choice for treating urinary tract infections in pregnant women, effectively targeting common pathogens like E. coli while minimizing risks to the developing fetus.", "metadata": {"original_question": "A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination.

{"prompt": "Question: A 3-month-old baby died suddenly at night while asleep. His mother noticed that he had died only after she awoke in the morning. No cause of death was determined based on the autopsy. Which of the following precautions could have prevented the death of the baby?\n\nOptions:\nA. Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping\nB. Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature\nC. Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position\nD. Avoiding pacifier use during sleep\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.", "chosen": "A. Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping\nExplanation: Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a leading cause of unexplained infant mortality during sleep.", "rejected": "B. Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature\nExplanation: Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature may prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) by ensuring warmth and comfort, which can reduce the risk of respiratory distress during sleep.", "metadata": {"original_question": "A 3-month-old baby died suddenly at night while asleep.

{"prompt": "Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?\n\nOptions:\nA. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud\nB. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize\nC. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus\nD. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline\n\nChoose the best answer and provide a step-by-step explanation for your choice.", "chosen": "A. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud\nExplanation: Abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud can lead to pancreaticobiliary maljunction, causing vomiting of bile (yellow) and possible obstruction, consistent with the infant's symptoms.", "rejected": "D. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline\nExplanation: The infant's yellow vomiting suggests a bile-stained output, which can occur due to obstruction; failure of lateral body folds to fuse can lead to congenital defects causing such issues.", "metadata": {"original_question": "A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits.

{"prompt": "Question: A pulmonary autopsy specimen from a 58-year-old woman who died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure was examined. She had recently undergone surgery for a fractured femur 3 months ago. Initial hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to a rehab facility in good health. Shortly after discharge home from rehab, she developed sudden shortness of breath and had cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. On histological examination of lung tissue, fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery is observed.
